# Kubernetes deployment (Pulumi)

This is the operator guide for running the full Grid OIB stack on a Kubernetes
cluster. The infrastructure is defined as code in
[`deploy/pulumi`](../../deploy/pulumi) (Pulumi / TypeScript); this document
explains the architecture, the storage/SeaweedFS decisions, how to deploy, and
— importantly — **how the agent scales**, now and later.

It is the k8s counterpart to [`coolify.md`](./coolify.md) (Docker Compose on
Coolify remains the other supported target).

## 1. Topology

One namespace (`grid`) holds every app + data workload. Platform add-ons live in
their own namespaces.

| Workload | k8s object | Replicas | Storage | Scales by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `aiq-agent` (agent: web + Dask + Chroma) | **StatefulSet** | **1** | RWO PVC `/app/data` | **Vertically** (CPU/mem + Dask knobs). Singleton today. |
| `frontend` (Next.js + BFF + WS gateway) | Deployment + HPA | 2→6 | — | Horizontally (CPU HPA) |
| `purger` | Deployment | 1 | — | n/a (SKIP LOCKED-safe) |
| `workflow-scheduler` | Deployment | 1 | — | n/a (DB-claimed ticks) |
| `postgres` (`aiq_jobs`, `aiq_checkpoints`, `grid_app`) | CloudNativePG `Cluster` | 1 (→3 HA) | RWO PVC | Add replicas |
| `dragonfly` (Redis-proto cache) | Deployment | 1 | — (cache) | — |
| `seaweedfs` (S3) | StatefulSet | 1 | RWO PVC `/data` | See §4 |

Platform add-ons installed by Pulumi: **cert-manager** (+ Let's Encrypt issuer,
Gateway-API-enabled), **Envoy Gateway** (Gateway API controller), and the
**CloudNativePG operator**. The HPAs need `metrics.k8s.io`, which the managed
provider already serves via its unremovable base metrics stack — so
`installMetricsServer` defaults to **false** (flip it true only on a bare
cluster with no metrics API). See §2b.

> Edge = **Gateway API**, not Ingress. The Kubernetes ingress-nginx controller
> is retired (maintenance ended 2026-03-31; no further releases or security
> patches), and the Gateway API is the project's modern successor to Ingress.
> We run **Envoy Gateway** (CNCF, Gateway-API native) with a `GatewayClass`,
> a `Gateway` (HTTP :80 for the ACME challenge + per-host HTTPS :443), and
> `HTTPRoute`s (`src/platform/gateway.ts`, `src/app/httproutes.ts`). TLS is
> issued by cert-manager's Gateway integration (`enableGatewayAPI`,
> `gatewayHTTPRoute` HTTP-01 solver). WebSocket upgrades + large uploads pass
> through natively.

Traffic:

```
Internet ──▶ Envoy Gateway ──┬─▶ app.<domain> (HTTPRoute) ──▶ frontend:3000 ──▶ aiq-agent:8000 (WS/REST)
                             └─▶ s3.<domain>  (HTTPRoute) ──▶ seaweedfs:8333 (presigned browser URLs)
```

## 2. Prerequisites

- A kubeconfig for the cluster (the provider gives you this).
- The provider's **StorageClass** name for block volumes — this is your
  **Lightbits** (NVMe/TCP) class. Find it: `kubectl get storageclass`.
- Container images in a registry. The [`publish-images`](../../.github/workflows/publish-images.yml)
  workflow builds and pushes `grid-oib-backend` and `grid-oib-frontend` to GHCR
  on merge to `develop`. Pin `imageTag` to a commit SHA for reproducible deploys.
- Pulumi CLI + Node 20+.

### Storage — what it is and isn't

The provider's CSI is **block** storage (NVMe/TCP, Lightbits under the hood),
exposed as **StorageClasses** that hand out fast ReadWriteOnce PVCs. It is *not*
an object store. So:

- Three classes ship, differing only in storage-level replica count:
  `premium` (**default**, 3 replicas), `standard` (2), `single-replica` (1).
  Set the one you want once via `grid-oib:storageClass` (prod → `premium`).
  `lightbits` is the **VolumeSnapshotClass** name (driver
  `csi.lightbitslabs.com`), *not* a StorageClass — don't set `storageClass` to it.
- **Only ReadWriteOnce** — no RWX. Every PVC here is RWO and each is mounted by a
  single pod (Postgres, SeaweedFS, Chroma, and the agent's per-replica
  `/app/data`), so this is a non-issue; just don't add an RWX volume expecting
  shared mounts. Because the CSI is network-attached (NVMe/TCP), an RWO volume
  still re-attaches to a *replacement* node after a node loss.
- **Reclaim policy is `Delete` on every class:** deleting a PVC destroys the
  volume and its data irreversibly. Two mitigations are wired/available — the
  StatefulSets pin `persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy: Retain` so deleting a
  workload never cascades a PVC delete, and you can patch a live PV to survive
  even a PVC delete: `kubectl patch pv <pv> -p '{"spec":{"persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy":"Retain"}}'`.
- Volumes **expand online** (grow `*StorageSize` then `pulumi up`); they cannot
  shrink. **VolumeSnapshots** are supported via the `lightbits` SnapshotClass.
- The **CSI driver / StorageClasses are provider-installed**; Pulumi only
  references a class by name. We do not install the driver.
- **S3 is provided by SeaweedFS**, which runs on top of one of these PVCs (§4).

## 2b. Managed provider (k0s) specifics — how this config accounts for them

The target is a **managed k0s** cluster (CNCF-conformant, standard Kubernetes
API). A handful of provider behaviours shape the manifests; each is handled so
you don't have to retrofit it.

**Automatic version upgrades drain nodes.** The provider upgrades Kubernetes and
replaces worker nodes on its own schedule, with no operator step — i.e. *routine*
voluntary node drains. Every multi-replica workload therefore carries a
**PodDisruptionBudget** (`maxUnavailable: 1`) and a soft **topologySpreadConstraint**
across `kubernetes.io/hostname` (`src/platform/scheduling.ts`, applied to
`frontend`, `agent-worker`, and the `db`-mode `aiq-agent` web tier; the Envoy
proxy already had both). A drain can then only take one replica at a time, and
replicas sit on different nodes so a single node loss never empties a tier.
Single-replica workloads deliberately get **no** PDB — `minAvailable: 1` on one
pod would block the drain forever and deadlock the upgrade. Postgres HA is
CloudNativePG's own PDB.

**Cluster-autoscaler scales on *unschedulable pods*, not utilisation.** Its
documented prerequisites — an HPA as the first scaling tier, `requests`/`limits`
on every container, and `topologySpreadConstraints` — are all met: HPAs on
`frontend` + `agent-worker`, requests **and** limits on every workload, and the
spread constraints above. So a burst first scales pods via HPA, and only if pods
go Pending does a node get added.

**Node loss wipes ephemeral storage; only PVCs survive.** On node replacement,
`emptyDir` / `hostPath` / container-fs are gone. This stack uses **none** of
those for durable data — no `emptyDir`, no `hostPath`, no DaemonSets anywhere —
so the k0s kubelet-path quirk (`/var/lib/k0s/kubelet` instead of
`/var/lib/kubelet`) is a non-issue here; the only ephemeral file is the
agent-worker's `/tmp` liveness marker, which is meant to be transient. All state
lives on PVCs (which survive) or in Postgres.

**Networking is Cilium, no kube-proxy.** All Service types work normally;
nothing in this program assumes kube-proxy. The edge Service is a
`LoadBalancer` that Cilium gives an external IP automatically. A released IP
stays **reserved for 14 days** and is reclaimable via the
`k8s.at/managed-loadbalancer-ip` annotation — set `grid-oib:loadBalancerIp` to
the assigned address after the first deploy and it's stamped onto the Envoy
Service, so DNS keeps resolving across any Gateway re-creation. (Inbound API
restriction — block / country- / IP-allowlist — and the dedicated outbound NAT
IP for egress whitelisting are Control-Center settings, not manifests.)

**Kubeconfig tokens expire (≤ 2 weeks).** The Control-Center kubeconfig is fine
for hands-on `pulumi up`, but a token baked into `grid-oib:kubeconfig` for
unattended CI/CD **will stop working within two weeks**. For automation, use the
provider's documented permanent-credential path: a ServiceAccount with a
non-expiring token Secret, then feed *that* kubeconfig to Pulumi. Least-privilege
RBAC is better than `cluster-admin` if your platform team scopes it, but at
minimum:

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system create serviceaccount grid-deployer
kubectl create clusterrolebinding grid-deployer \
  --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:grid-deployer
kubectl -n kube-system apply -f - <<'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: grid-deployer-token
  namespace: kube-system
  annotations: { kubernetes.io/service-account.name: grid-deployer }
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
EOF
# Build a kubeconfig from that token + the cluster CA/endpoint and store it:
#   pulumi config set --secret grid-oib:kubeconfig "$(cat grid-deployer.kubeconfig)"
```

Revoke it by deleting the Secret/ServiceAccount when it's no longer needed — it
does **not** expire on its own.

**Provider add-ons.** A base **metrics** stack (serving `metrics.k8s.io`) is
always provisioned and cannot be removed, so `installMetricsServer` defaults to
**false** — installing our own would just fight it (the HPAs read the built-in
one). Managed **Backups** (Velero) and **Metrics** (Grafana) are paid Control-
Center add-ons; CNPG PITR and a Prometheus/Grafana/Loki stack remain the
in-cluster follow-ups in §7. A cheap interim backup is a scheduled
**VolumeSnapshot** (SnapshotClass `lightbits`) of the Postgres and SeaweedFS PVCs.

## 3. Deploy

Full command list is in [`deploy/pulumi/README.md`](../../deploy/pulumi/README.md).
In short:

```bash
cd deploy/pulumi
npm install
pulumi stack init prod
# edit Pulumi.prod.yaml placeholders, then set --secret values (kubeconfig,
# pgAppPassword, seaweedfsSecretKey, tokens, OpenRouter/Tavily/WorkOS keys)
pulumi up
```

Then:

1. `kubectl -n envoy-gateway-system get svc` → note the Envoy proxy LoadBalancer external IP.
2. Point DNS `A`/`AAAA` records for `appDomain` and `s3Domain` at it.
3. Leave `useStagingIssuer: true` until the ingress is reachable and a staging
   cert issues (avoids Let's Encrypt rate limits); then set it `false` and
   `pulumi up` for a trusted cert.
4. Verify: `kubectl -n grid get pods,pvc,httproute,gateway,cluster`.

The base OIB corpus is **not** shipped in the image or from git — it is
volume-based. Load it through the platform-admin upload UI once the stack is up;
it persists on the agent's `/app/data` PVC and is embedded into Chroma on the
fly.

---

## 4. SeaweedFS — decision and scale-out path

**What we run:** the exact single-node topology proven in Docker Compose — one
`weed server -s3` process running master + volume + filer + the S3 gateway — as
a 1-replica StatefulSet, but with its data on a durable Lightbits PVC instead of
an ephemeral local volume. S3 identities come from a Kubernetes Secret (mounted
as `s3.json`); a one-shot Job pre-creates the `grid-documents` bucket.

**Why:** it is the lowest-risk, faithful migration of a battle-tested setup, and
the app's object load (PDFs, presigned preview/download) is modest. Fewer moving
parts than a modular cluster.

**When to scale out** (any of: volume-server disk pressure, throughput ceiling,
you want HA object storage): migrate to the upstream **SeaweedFS Helm chart**
(or operator), which splits master / volume / filer into separate StatefulSets
and lets you run N volume servers and move the filer metadata store onto
Postgres. Because the bucket name (`grid-documents`) and object-key layout are
unchanged, this is a data-preserving migration (an `rclone sync` or the existing
`scripts/migrate-storage.mjs` between the old and new S3 endpoints — the same
pattern used for the MinIO→SeaweedFS cutover in
[`minio-to-seaweedfs-migration.md`](./minio-to-seaweedfs-migration.md)).

---

## 5. Postgres (CloudNativePG)

A single `Cluster` hosts all three logical databases. `aiq_jobs` is the
bootstrapped app DB; `aiq_checkpoints` and `grid_app` are created (owned by the
`aiq` role) at bootstrap via `postInitSQL`. An idempotent Job creates the job +
checkpoint tables; the frontend's `drizzle-kit migrate` Job owns `grid_app`'s
schema.

- **HA:** `grid-oib:pgInstances: 3` (the prod default) runs one primary + two
  streaming replicas with automatic failover; `primaryUpdateStrategy:
  unsupervised` lets CNPG switch over + roll on its own when the provider drains
  a node. Replicas use `preferred` pod anti-affinity on `kubernetes.io/hostname`
  so they spread across worker nodes. Apps always talk to the `grid-pg-rw`
  service (the current primary).
- **Backups (PITR) — IMPLEMENTED.** With `grid-oib:pgBackupsEnabled: true` (prod
  default) CNPG archives WAL continuously and takes a nightly base backup to a
  `grid-pg-backups` SeaweedFS bucket (auto-created) via its Barman object-store
  integration — the only recovery path from the provider's `Delete` reclaim
  policy. Tune with `pgBackupRetention` (default `30d`) and `pgBackupSchedule`
  (6-field cron, default `0 0 2 * * *`). Restore is `kubectl cnpg`/a bootstrap
  `recovery` from the same object store. Credentials come from the
  `grid-pg-backup-s3` Secret (the SeaweedFS access/secret key).

---

## 6. How the agent scales — the important part

The agent (`aiq-agent`) is the token-heavy core and the thing you most want to
scale. Its scaling story has two phases. This is grounded in
[`../architecture/scaling-review-2026-07.md`](../architecture/scaling-review-2026-07.md),
which inventories exactly what pins work to one process.

### 6.1 Today: vertical scaling (wired and working)

The agent is a **hard singleton** — it embeds ChromaDB, a private localhost Dask
cluster, and in-process job/citation state — so you scale it **up**, not out:

- **CPU / memory:** `backendRequestsCpu/Memory`, `backendLimitsCpu/Memory`.
- **Research parallelism:** `backendDaskWorkers`, `backendDaskThreads` — the
  in-process Dask cluster that executes deep-research fan-out.
- **Admission control (protects the pod under load):** `backendMaxActiveJobs`,
  `backendMaxActiveJobsPerOrg` bound concurrent deep-research runs;
  `backendIngestMaxWorkers` bounds concurrent ingestion. A burst of users then
  degrades gracefully (429 / friendly message) instead of starving the event
  loop or exhausting provider rate limits.

Two preconditions for *any* scaling are already done in this deployment, so you
never have to retrofit them:

- **Postgres everywhere, never SQLite** — job store, checkpoints, summaries, the
  SSE `LISTEN` DSN, and durable deep-research checkpoints (`AIQ_DEEP_CHECKPOINT_DB`)
  all point at CloudNativePG. Restarts no longer lose durable state.
- **A shared Redis cache** (Dragonfly) is wired into both tiers, so cross-replica
  caches are consistent the moment a second replica appears.

For a large majority of real workloads, a well-resourced single agent pod plus
these admission caps is enough — especially after the low-effort event-loop fix
below lands.

### 6.2 The highest-impact code change (do this first)

Per scaling-review §6.2, the single biggest capacity defect is that
`LlamaIndexRetriever.retrieve` (`sources/knowledge_layer/src/llamaindex/adapter.py`)
does a **synchronous** embedding call + Chroma query on the only event loop —
one user's retrieval stalls every other user's chat stream. Wrapping it in
`asyncio.to_thread` (hours of work, no behaviour change) is the difference
between "one slow tenant degrades everyone" and healthy concurrency. This is a
backend code change, tracked separately from this deployment.

### 6.3 Horizontal research execution — IMPLEMENTED (`jobExecution: db`)

The token-heavy workload (deep research) now scales out. Set
`grid-oib:jobExecution: db` and:

- **Research runs on DB-claimed workers** (ADR-0021): submission writes a
  `SUBMITTED` `job_info` row and enqueues a claimable `research_job_queue` row
  (`frontends/aiq_api/src/aiq_api/jobs/queue.py`); dedicated **`agent-worker`**
  replicas (same image, `GRID_ROLE=worker`) claim rows with `FOR UPDATE SKIP
  LOCKED`, run the same `run_agent_job` body, and heartbeat the claim so a crash
  is reclaimed. An HPA scales them on CPU. The web tier runs **no Dask** in this
  mode.
- **Cancellation works from any replica** — the cancel route flips `job_info` to
  INTERRUPTED and drops the queue row; the runner's 1 s `CancellationMonitor`
  honors it. No scheduler is involved.
- **Shared vectors** (Stage A, `chromaEnabled: true`): the shared Chroma server
  means workers and web replicas read/write one store.
- **Citation registry** already shares cross-replica via Dragonfly (ADR-0020).

Safe rollout: `jobExecution: dask` (default in code) is byte-for-byte today's
behaviour; flip to `db` per environment. `agentWorkerMinReplicas` /
`agentWorkerMaxReplicas` / `agentWorkerConcurrency` size the worker tier.

### 6.4 Multi-replica chat/web tier — IMPLEMENTED (`jobExecution: db`)

In `db` mode the `aiq-agent` web tier now runs `backendReplicas` replicas
(default 2). The chat/retrieval path is replica-safe:

- **Vectors** are shared (Chroma server, §6.3); **job/checkpoint state** is in
  Postgres; **caches + citation registry** are in Dragonfly.
- **Ingestion status is persisted** to a shared `ingest_jobs` table
  (`src/aiq_agent/knowledge/ingest_status_store.py`), so a
  `GET /v1/documents/{job_id}/status` poll resolves from any replica instead of
  404-ing on the replica that didn't accept the upload.
- **The two unlocked background loops are now single-runner**: the ghost-job
  reaper (`routes/jobs.py`) and the knowledge TTL-cleanup thread
  (`knowledge/base.py` via `knowledge/leader_lock.py`) elect one runner per
  cycle with a Postgres advisory lock, so N replicas don't double-reap or race
  `delete_collection` against the shared store.

It stays a StatefulSet (stable identity + a per-replica RWO PVC on Lightbits).

**One documented caveat — base-corpus admin upload.** The platform-owner
base-corpus upload writes PDFs to a per-replica `OIB_UPLOADS_DIR`; the uploaded
file (and a later re-sync of *that file*) lives only on the replica that
received it. The vectors it produces are ingested into shared Chroma and are
searchable from every replica, so **chat is unaffected** — only re-ingesting or
removing that specific source PDF is replica-local. Route `OIB_UPLOADS_DIR`
through SeaweedFS to make that admin flow fully replica-agnostic (scoped
follow-up); high-traffic chat/retrieval does not need it.

---

## 7. Security & hardening (what's wired)

- **Pod Security:** the `grid` namespace enforces the `baseline` standard, and
  every first-party workload container runs with a restricted-compliant
  securityContext (`runAsNonRoot`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`,
  `capabilities.drop: [ALL]`, `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`) — see
  `src/platform/security.ts`. Bootstrap Jobs get the same minus the fixed UID.
  Third-party workloads (CNPG, SeaweedFS, Chroma, Dragonfly) keep their images'
  own contexts, which is why the namespace stays at `baseline` not `restricted`.
- **NetworkPolicies** (`grid-oib:networkPolicies`, default **on**): a
  default-deny for ingress plus least-privilege allows — intra-namespace, the
  edge (Envoy) to `frontend`/`seaweedfs`, and the CNPG operator to its pods.
  Egress is deliberately open (the agent calls many external LLM/search APIs);
  tightening it is the one item that needs a live-cluster validation pass first.
- **Image pull policy** resolves to `Always` for the moving `latest` tag (so a
  rescheduled pod never silently runs a stale image) and `IfNotPresent` for a
  pinned SHA. Pin `imageTag` to a SHA in prod for reproducible deploys — the
  deploy workflow already does this for staging.

## 8. CI/CD

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` deploys the **dev** stack automatically after
`Publish Images` succeeds on `develop`, pinning `imageTag` to that commit's
immutable `sha-<sha>` tag (never `latest`) and running `tsc --noEmit` as a
cluster-free gate before `pulumi up`. It needs a `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` repo
secret and a stack whose `kubeconfig` secret is a **non-expiring ServiceAccount
token** (§2b), not the Control-Center download. Prod is promoted manually.

## 9. Out of scope (deliberate follow-ups)

- SeaweedFS modular HA cluster (§4) — single-node today; its PVC survives node
  loss (NVMe/TCP re-attach), so a node drain is a brief reschedule, not data loss.
- The backend refactors that unlock horizontal agent scaling (§6.3).
- Egress NetworkPolicies (needs per-endpoint validation on a live cluster).
- An observability stack (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki). Envoy Gateway, cert-manager,
  CNPG, and SeaweedFS all expose Prometheus metrics, so this is a natural next
  layer — and the provider's paid Metrics (Grafana) add-on is the quick option.

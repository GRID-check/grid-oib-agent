/**
 * Visual screenshot registry — the single source of truth for the surfaces the
 * screenshot harness captures. Each target points at a self-contained `/dev/*`
 * preview route that renders a real component with fixture data (no backend), so
 * a screenshot is reproducible in CI and locally.
 *
 * Add a target here when you build a user-visible surface worth capturing as
 * evidence; give it a `/dev` preview route that renders the real component. The
 * harness (`visual/capture.mjs`) writes `<id>.light.png` / `<id>.dark.png` into
 * `visual/screenshots/`. See `docs/ux/visual-screenshots.md`.
